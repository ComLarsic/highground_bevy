## How to run
Note: The game can be compiled but still requires the game assets to work, 
you can acquire those by copying them from a copy of the game or get them from the repository if you have access.

The game can be run directly by using cargo
or by compiling it and then running the executable
```bash
# Run the game
cargo run --release
# Compile the game executable
cargo build --release
```
